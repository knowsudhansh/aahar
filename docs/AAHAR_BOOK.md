# AAHAR Master Knowledge Base

Version: 1.0
Last Updated Context: Current development state after Phase 4.6F Global Location Context and Item Price Master fixes
Purpose: Preserve the complete AAHAR project knowledge so the project can continue with any developer or AI tool even if the current chat history is unavailable.

---

## 1. Project Summary

AAHAR is a hospital-based Food and Cafeteria Management Platform for Max Healthcare style operations.

AAHAR manages the complete lifecycle:

```text
Location setup
-> Store/F&B setup
-> Kitchen setup
-> Restaurant setup
-> POS device/payment machine setup
-> Item category and item master
-> Item price master
-> Menu and item mapping
-> MRP procurement through manual GRN
-> Store stock
-> Kitchen production
-> Kitchen stock
-> Store/Kitchen transfer to Restaurant
-> Restaurant acknowledgement
-> Restaurant stock
-> Restaurant operations
-> POS billing
-> Order/KOT
-> Payments
-> Closing
-> Supervisor approval
-> ERP/SUN posting
-> Reports and audit
```

The system is being developed as an enterprise-grade hospital F&B operations platform, not a simple cafeteria billing app.

## 6. Important Terminology Decision

Originally the top-level entity was called Hospital.

Business later requested this to be called Location in the UI.

Current decision:

```text
Business UI term: Location
Internal backend/database term: Hospital / hospitalId
```

Reason: many existing modules depend on hospitalId. Renaming all backend references now could break GRN, stock, transfers, kitchen production, restaurant stock, and future POS. Therefore, UI uses Location while internal code can keep hospitalId.

---

## 7. Core Business Hierarchy

Current structure:

```text
Location (internal Hospital)
|-- Store/F&B
|-- Kitchen
|-- Restaurant
|-- POS Devices
|-- Payment Machines
```

When a new Location is created:

```text
Default Main Store is auto-created
Default Main Kitchen is auto-created
```

Additional stores and kitchens can be manually created later.

---

## 8. Item Type Flows

AAHAR has three item types.

### MRP / Packed Item Flow

```text
Item Master
-> Store Item Mapping
-> GRN
-> Accepted batch quantity
-> Store Stock
-> Store to Restaurant Transfer
-> Restaurant Acknowledgement
-> Restaurant Stock
-> Future POS Sale
```

Examples:

```text
Water bottle
Coke
Chips
Packed juice
```

Rules:

```text
MRP item requires batch number
MRP item requires expiry date
GRN only accepts MRP items mapped to the selected store
Stock remains batch-wise internally
Transfer UI shows item-first selection and internally allocates batches using FEFO
```

### READYMADE / Kitchen Item Flow

```text
Item Master
-> Kitchen Item Mapping
-> Kitchen Production
-> Post Production
-> Kitchen Stock
-> Kitchen to Restaurant Transfer
-> Restaurant Acknowledgement
-> Restaurant Stock
-> Future POS Sale
```

Examples:

```text
Samosa
Pakora
Sandwich
Poha
Thali
```

Rules:

```text
Only READYMADE items can be mapped to Kitchen
Only READYMADE items can be produced
Produced quantity minus wastage quantity becomes accepted stock
Kitchen stock transfers to Restaurant
```

### LIVE Item Flow

```text
Item Master
-> Restaurant Menu Mapping
-> Time slot/day availability
-> Future Order/KOT
```

Examples:

```text
Dosa
Paratha
Chole Bhature
Fresh meal
```

Rules:

```text
LIVE items do not need stock in current phase
LIVE items require menu availability and future KOT
```

---

## 10. Pending High-Priority Modules

### 10.1 Phase 4.6D - POS Device Master and Payment Machine Master (Delivered)

Business requested Counter to be renamed to POS/POS Devices.

Structure:

```text
POS
|-- POS Devices
|-- Payment Machines
```

POS Device fields:

```text
Name
Code
Active
Location/Hospital
Restaurants multi-select
Entity placeholder
Host Name
KOT Print toggle
Invoice Print toggle
```

POS Device to Restaurant relation:

```text
Many-to-many
One POS device can map to multiple restaurants
One restaurant can use multiple POS devices
```

Tables:

```text
pos_devices
pos_device_restaurants
```

Payment Machine fields:

```text
Location/Hospital
POS Device
Status
Name
Serial Number
Pine Labs Merchant ID
Pine Labs Security Token
Pine Labs IMEI
Pine Labs Merchant Store POS Code
Primary UPI: PHONEPE, UPI_PAYTM, UPI_SALE, UPI_BHARAT_QR (BHARATPE, GOOGLE_PAY, OTHER retained)
Default toggle (one live default per POS device)
```

Security:

```text
Pine Labs Security Token is sensitive
Do not log token
Mask token in UI
In production move to Key Vault or encrypted field
```

BA validations implemented:

```text
Host name must be unique across live POS devices
  Duplicate save is rejected naming the restaurants already tagged to that host name
POS device name/code/host name accept alphanumerics plus space . - _
Serial number, Pinelab merchant id and store POS code are digits only
Pinelab IMEI is alphanumeric
Only one live payment machine per POS device can hold the Default flag
  Turning Default on demotes the previous holder in the same transaction and audits both rows
  A partial unique index backs the rule at the database level
Restaurant mappings are only rewritten when the caller sends a list,
  or when a location change invalidates them
```

Screen behaviour:

```text
Create and edit open as pop-ups over the grid
Status, KOT Print, Invoice Print, Active and Default render as toggle buttons
  and write through directly from the grid
Restaurant's Accessibility is a per-row action opening a multi-select pop-up
Grid pages at 20 records by default with a 10/20/25/50 page-size selector
Search covers every column shown in the grid
```

Notes:

```text
Interactive primitives (Modal, Toggle) live in components/ui-controls.tsx marked 'use client'
  so server-rendered pages keep importing components/ui.tsx without entering the client bundle
```

### 10.2 Phase 4.6E - UI Foundation and Dashboard Upgrade

Goals:

```text
Max Healthcare branding
AAHAR logo integration
Favicon
Modern light theme
Optional dark theme
Modern sidebar/topbar

```

UI color direction:

```text
Primary Max Blue: #0B5CAD
Deep Navy: #0F172A
Primary Teal: #0F766E
Emerald: #10B981
Mint Background: #ECFDF5
Page Background: #F8FAFC

Info Blue: #2563EB
```

Dashboard V1 should show:

```text
Locations
Stores
Kitchens
Restaurants
Items
Employees
GRNs
Transfers
Pending Acknowledgements
Store Stock
Kitchen Stock
Restaurant Stock
Recent GRNs
Recent Transfers
Inventory summary
```

### 10.3 Phase 5A - Restaurant Operations / Menu Availability

Goal:

```text
Create Restaurant Operations foundation before POS.
```

GET /api/v1/restaurant-operations/summary
```

Menu availability rules:

```text
Restaurant active
Item active
Restaurant menu mapping active/available
Day of week valid
Time slot valid
MRP and READYMADE need restaurant stock > 0
LIVE needs menu/time validity but no stock in current phase
```

Availability statuses:

```text
AVAILABLE
OUT_OF_STOCK
TIME_NOT_AVAILABLE
DAY_NOT_AVAILABLE
INACTIVE
NOT_MAPPED
PRICE_NOT_CONFIGURED (recommended future)
```

### 10.4 Phase 5B - POS Billing

Future POS billing will need:

```text
Restaurant stock
Menu availability
Item price master
POS device master
Payment machine master
Cart
Invoice
KOT
Payment modes
Stock deduction
```

Do not start POS until POS Device Master and Restaurant Operations are ready.

---

## 11. Important Business Rules

Orders
Payments
Closing
ERP
Reports
```

Business date exists because restaurants may close after midnight.

---

## 12. Database and Prisma Notes

Database is already integrated and actively used.

Key DB components:

```text
PostgreSQL
Prisma schema
Prisma migrations
Prisma Client
Seed script
Docker local database
```

Local DB connection:

```text
Host: localhost
Port: 5433
Database: aahar
User: aahar
Password: aahar_password
```

Use Prisma Studio for viewing data:

```powershell
pnpm exec prisma studio --schema prisma/schema.prisma
```

Important:

```text
Use Prisma Studio mainly for viewing data.
Do not manually edit stock_balances or stock_ledgers.
Stock must change only through workflows: GRN, Transfer, Acknowledgement, Kitchen Production.
```

Development migration:

```powershell
pnpm db:migrate
```

Sandbox/UAT/Production migration:

```powershell
pnpm db:deploy
```

Never use migrate dev in production.

---

## 13. Deployment Notes

Render was attempted for quick sharing.

Render deployment issue encountered:

```text
Auth service built successfully but runtime failed to find @aahar/config/dist/index.js.
```

Root cause:

```text
pnpm monorepo workspace packages are not packaged/resolved correctly at runtime when deploying a single service on Render.
```

Recommendation:

```text
Do not continue ad-hoc Render troubleshooting during active feature development.
Finish foundation modules first.
Then run a dedicated Deployment Preparation Sprint.
```

Future deployment should include:

```text
Monorepo-aware build/start scripts
Possibly Docker-based deployment
Shared package runtime resolution
PostgreSQL
Redis
Migrations/seeding
CORS setup
Environment variables
```

Preferred long-term production hosting:

```text
Azure
```

Possible demo/sandbox hosting:

```text
Render
Railway
Azure Sandbox
```

---

## 14. UI / UX Direction

AAHAR UI should look like:

```text
Modern SaaS dashboard
Healthcare-grade enterprise app
Food and cafeteria management platform
Inventory and restaurant operations system
Clean, premium, responsive
```

Default theme:

```text
Light theme
```

Optional:

```text
Dark theme for kitchen/POS/night shift
```

Key UI principles:

```text
Modern sidebar
Top header
Global Location selector
KPI cards
Charts
Status badges
Grouped forms
Responsive tables
Expandable rows for stock
Friendly errors
Loading skeletons
Empty states
```

Current Global Location Selector requirement completed:

```text
Compact location pin in top-right header
Click opens popover
Shows All Locations and active Locations
Selecting filters data globally
```

Stock page UX pending:

```text
Store Stock should group by item and expand to batch details.
Restaurant Stock and Kitchen Stock should later follow similar grouping.
```

---

## 15. Role-Based UI Plan

AAHAR should eventually have role-specific screens/portals while using the same backend.

### Admin Portal

Users:

```text
Super Admin
Location Admin
IT/Admin team
```

Screens:

```text
Locations
Stores
Kitchens
Restaurants
Masters
Mappings
Pricing
Inventory
Settings
Reports
```

### Store Portal

Users:

```text
Store Manager
Store Receiver
```

Screens:

```text
GRN
Store Stock
Transfers
Stock Ledgers
```

### Kitchen Portal

Users:

```text
Chef
Kitchen Operator
```

Screens:

```text
Kitchen Production
Kitchen Stock
Kitchen Transfers
Future KOT Queue
```

### Restaurant Portal

Users:

```text
Restaurant Manager
Restaurant Operator
```

Screens:

```text
Pending Acknowledgements
Restaurant Stock
Menu Availability
Closing
```

### POS Portal

Users:

```text
POS Operator
```

Screens:

```text
Billing
Cart
Payment
Invoice
KOT
```

### Supervisor Portal

Users:

```text
Supervisor
```

Screens:

```text
Approvals
Closing Mismatch
Wastage
Delivery Assignment
```

### Finance/ERP Portal

Users:

```text
Finance User
```

Screens:

```text
Payments
Reconciliation
ERP/SUN Posting
Reports
```

Do not create all portals immediately. Build shared design system and permission-driven navigation first.

## 16. Known Development Issues and Fixes

### Next.js Turbopack Runtime Error

Error:

```text
Cannot find module '../chunks/ssr/[turbopack]_runtime.js'
```

Fix:

```powershell
Get-Process node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force apps/admin-portal/.next -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .turbo -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
pnpm dev
```

### Prisma EPERM on Windows

Error:

```text
EPERM operation not permitted rename query_engine-windows.dll.node
```

Fix:

```powershell
Get-Process node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
pnpm db:generate
```

### OTP Failed / Failed to Fetch

Causes:

```text
Auth service not running
Frontend env points to wrong IP
CORS issue
Stale Node process
```

Fix local env:

```text
apps/admin-portal/.env.local
```

Use:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4001/api/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_API_URL=http://localhost:4001/api/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_API_URL=http://localhost:4002/api/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZATION_API_URL=http://localhost:4003/api/v1
```

### CORS Local Network Issue

If team opens frontend using local IP, backend must allow that frontend origin in CORS_ORIGINS.

But office firewall/VPN may still block it.

Recommended team sharing right now:

```text
GitHub access for developers
Screen recording/screenshots for BA/manager
Sandbox deployment later
```

## 17. AI Tool Handoff Instructions

If switching to another AI tool, provide these files first:

```text
docs/AAHAR_BOOK.md
docs/CODEX_MASTER_PROMPT.md
docs/CODEX_RULES.md
docs/BRD.md
docs/ERD.md
docs/TRD.md
docs/FSD.md
docs/API_SPEC.md
docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
docs/UI_UX_GUIDELINES.md
docs/UI_REFERENCE.md
docs/SESSION_MANAGEMENT.md
docs/ERROR_HANDLING.md
docs/REGRESSION_CHECKLIST.md
docs/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md
docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
```

Tell the AI:

```text
Do not modify business logic unless explicitly asked.
Do not modify Prisma schema unless required.
Do not break completed modules.
Follow regression checklist before commit.
AAHAR uses Location as business UI term but hospitalId internally.
Phase 4.6D POS Device Master + Payment Machine Master is delivered.
Current next pending phase is Phase 4.6E UI Foundation and Dashboard Upgrade unless BA provides new changes.
```

---

## 18. Immediate Next Recommended Work

Phase 4.6D POS Device Master + Payment Machine Master is delivered, so POS Billing and
Restaurant Operations now have the master data they depend on:

```text
POS Billing needs POS Device
Payment flow needs Payment Machine
Restaurant operations need clear POS setup
Pine Labs needs terminal/master data
```

The next planned phases are:

```text
Phase 4.6E - UI Foundation and Dashboard Upgrade
Phase 5A - Restaurant Operations / Menu Availability
Phase 5B - POS Billing

## 20. Important Product Decisions

### Decision 1: Location vs Hospital

Business calls it Location; internal system can keep Hospital/hospitalId for stability.

### Decision 2: Item codes auto-generated

Format:

```text
ITM0001
ITM0002
```

### Decision 3: Store/Kitchen/Restaurant codes auto-generated

Formats:

```text
STR0001
KIT0001
RST0001
```

### Decision 4: Batch-wise DB, grouped UI

Database must stay batch-wise; UI can group by item for user friendliness.

### Decision 5: FEFO allocation

Transfer should default to item-first selection and FEFO batch allocation, with manual batch mode for advanced use.

### Decision 6: Price master required before POS

POS cannot be built until item prices exist.

### Decision 7: POS Device and Payment Machine required before POS Billing

POS Billing needs device/payment configuration.

### Decision 8: UI Foundation before POS

It is better to establish visual system before building POS because POS is a large UI-heavy module.

Priorities:

```text

User-friendly UI

```

Never trade stock correctness, payment safety, or auditability for speed.
