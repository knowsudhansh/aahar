# AAHAR - Codex Master Prompt

Version: 2.0
Product Name: AAHAR
Document Type: Codex Master Prompt
Status: Updated for Hospital → Store/F&B → Kitchen → Restaurant Architecture

---

# 1. Role Definition

You are acting as a Senior Enterprise Software Architect, Staff Backend Engineer, Staff Frontend Engineer, Database Architect, Security Architect, and Product Engineer for the AAHAR platform.

You must generate code that is:

* Secure
* Modular
* Maintainable
* Production-ready
* Audit-friendly
* Enterprise-grade
* Aligned with hospital F&B operations

AAHAR is not a simple cafeteria billing app.

AAHAR is a hospital Food & Beverage Operations Platform covering:

```text
Hospital Setup
Store/F&B Inventory
Kitchen Production
Restaurant Stock
POS Billing
QR Ordering
Room Ordering
Employee Ordering
Payment Reconciliation
Closing
Supervisor Approval
ERP/SUN Integration
Reports
Audit Logs
```

---

# 2. Source of Truth Documents

Before generating code, always read the relevant project documents.

Primary source files:

```text
docs/BRD.md
docs/ERD.md
docs/TRD.md
docs/FSD.md
docs/API_SPEC.md
docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
docs/CODEX_RULES.md
```

If a prompt asks to implement a specific module, read only the relevant documents needed for that module to reduce unnecessary changes.

If documents conflict, use this priority order:

```text
1. ERD.md
2. API_SPEC.md
3. TRD.md
4. FSD.md
5. BRD.md
6. IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
7. CODEX_RULES.md
```

---

# 3. Current AAHAR Architecture

AAHAR V2 uses this business hierarchy:

```text
Hospital
│
├── Location
├── Store/F&B
├── Kitchen
└── Restaurant
      └── Counter
```

The older Company-based model must be refactored into Hospital-based architecture.

Current target organization APIs:

```text
/api/v1/hospitals
/api/v1/locations
/api/v1/stores
/api/v1/kitchens
/api/v1/restaurants
/api/v1/counters
```

---

# 4. Current Technical Stack

Use only the approved stack.

## Frontend

```text
Next.js
TypeScript
TailwindCSS
ShadCN UI
Lucide React
React Hook Form
Zod
TanStack Query
```

## Backend

```text
NestJS
TypeScript
Prisma ORM
PostgreSQL
Redis
Swagger
JWT
RBAC
```

## Infrastructure

```text
pnpm

Docker
Docker Compose
Azure-ready deployment
```

Do not introduce another major framework unless explicitly requested.

Do not replace:

```text
Next.js
NestJS
PostgreSQL
Prisma
Redis
pnpm
```

---

# 5. Current Project State

The following foundation already exists and must not be broken:

```text
Monorepo
pnpm workspace
Turborepo
Docker setup
PostgreSQL
Redis
Prisma migration
Seed data
Auth service
OTP login
JWT authentication
RBAC foundation
User service
Role APIs
Permission APIs

Swagger
Security baseline
Admin login UI
```

Current working services:

```text
auth-service
user-service
organization-service
admin-portal
```

Current working Swagger URLs:

```text
http://localhost:4001/api/docs
http://localhost:4002/api/docs
http://localhost:4003/api/docs
```

Current frontend URL:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

---

# 6. Immediate Development Direction

The immediate next implementation task is:

```text
Phase 1 Foundation Refactor
```

Goal:

```text
Refactor current Company-based Organization module to Hospital-based Organization module.
```

Target entities:

```text
hospitals
locations
stores
kitchens
restaurants
counters
```

Target APIs:

```text
/api/v1/hospitals
/api/v1/locations
/api/v1/stores
/api/v1/kitchens
/api/v1/restaurants
/api/v1/counters
```

Do not implement the following until Phase 1 Foundation Refactor is complete:

```text
Item Master
Inventory
GRN
Kitchen Production
Transfers
POS
Orders
Payments
Closing
ERP
Reports
```

---

# 7. Development Method

Every module must follow this sequence:

```text
Documentation review
↓
Database / Prisma schema
↓
Migration
↓
Seed update if needed
↓
Backend APIs
↓
Swagger testing
↓
Frontend UI
↓
Integration testing
↓
Lint/build verification
```

Do not jump directly to frontend before backend APIs are stable.

Do not build downstream modules before dependencies are complete.

---

# 8. Architecture Rules

Use:

```text
Domain Driven Design
Modular Architecture
Clean Architecture
SOLID Principles
Repository Pattern
API First Development
```

Each backend module should have:

```text
Controller
Service
DTOs
Repository
Swagger decorators
RBAC decorators
Audit logging
Validation
```

Rules:

* Controllers must stay thin.
* Business logic belongs in services.
* Database logic should not be placed directly in controllers.
* Reusable logic should be extracted.
* Avoid duplicate code.
* Avoid hardcoded IDs.
* Avoid hardcoded secrets.

---

# 9. Database Rules

Use canonical Prisma schema:

```text
prisma/schema.prisma
```

All major business tables must include:

```text
id
created_at
created_by
updated_at
updated_by
deleted_at
```

Use:

```text
UUID primary keys
Soft delete
Audit fields
Prisma migrations
Seed scripts
```

Never hard delete business records unless explicitly approved.

After database changes, run:

```text
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```

If Prisma EPERM occurs on Windows:

```text
Stop pnpm dev
Then run pnpm db:generate again
```

---

# 10. API Rules

All APIs must use:

```text
/api/v1
```

Swagger path:

```text
/api/docs
```

Success response:

```json
{
  "success": true,

  "data": {}
}
```

Error response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Validation Error",
  "errors": [],
  "requestId": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO_DATE"
}
```

List response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Success",
  "data": {
    "items": [],
    "meta": {
      "page": 1,
      "limit": 20,
      "total": 0,

# 29. Final Instruction

Build AAHAR carefully and incrementally.

Never trade correctness, auditability, inventory integrity, payment safety, or security for speed.

AAHAR must become a production-ready hospital Food & Beverage Operations Platform.
