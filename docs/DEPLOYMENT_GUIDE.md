* Production

AAHAR includes:

* Admin Portal
* Auth Service
* User Service
* Organization Service
* Future Inventory Service
* Future Kitchen Service
* Future POS / Order Service

# 2. Current Local Development Setup

Current local services:

| Component            | URL                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Admin Portal         | http://localhost:3000          |
| Auth Service         | http://localhost:4001          |
| User Service         | http://localhost:4002          |
| Organization Service | http://localhost:4003          |
| Auth Swagger         | http://localhost:4001/api/docs |
| User Swagger         | http://localhost:4002/api/docs |
| Organization Swagger | http://localhost:4003/api/docs |

# 7. Local Network Demo

If another user on the same network needs to access AAHAR:

Example laptop IP:

```text
172.25.208.1
```

Admin Portal URL:

```text
http://172.25.208.1:3000
```

Backend APIs must also be reachable:

```text
http://172.25.208.1:4001/api/docs
http://172.25.208.1:4002/api/docs
http://172.25.208.1:4003/api/docs
```

Update `apps/admin-portal/.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://172.25.208.1:4001/api/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_API_URL=http://172.25.208.1:4001/api/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_API_URL=http://172.25.208.1:4002/api/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZATION_API_URL=http://172.25.208.1:4003/api/v1
```

Update root `.env`:

```env
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000,http://172.25.208.1:3000
```

Restart:

```powershell
Get-Process node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
pnpm dev
```

Important:

Office firewall, VPN, or Wi-Fi isolation may block this. For reliable team testing, use Sandbox environment.

# 8. Common Local Issues

## 8.1 Prisma EPERM on Windows

Error:

```text
EPERM: operation not permitted, rename query_engine-windows.dll.node
```

Cause:

```text
Node/Nest service is locking Prisma engine.
```

Fix:

```powershell
Get-Process node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
pnpm db:generate
```

---

## 8.2 Next.js Turbopack Runtime Error

Error:

```text
Cannot find module '../chunks/ssr/[turbopack]_runtime.js'
```

Fix:

```powershell
Get-Process node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force apps/admin-portal/.next -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .turbo -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
pnpm dev
```

If repeated, disable Turbopack in Admin Portal dev script.

---

## 8.3 OTP Failed / Failed to Fetch

Check:

```text
http://localhost:4001/api/v1/health
```

If Auth Service is OK, check:

```text
apps/admin-portal/.env.local
```

pnpm dev
```

If Next cache issue:

```powershell
Get-Process node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force apps/admin-portal/.next -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .turbo -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
