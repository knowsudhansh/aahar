# 3. Important Refactor Required

The earlier model used:

```text
Company
↓
Location
↓
Restaurant
```

The new approved model is:

```text
Hospital
│
├── Location
├── Store/F&B
├── Kitchen
└── Restaurant
      └── Counter
```

Therefore, the current Organization module must be refactored.

---

# 4. Implementation Rules

## 4.1 Development Cycle

Every module must follow this cycle:

```text
Documentation
↓
Database / Prisma
↓
Backend API
↓
Swagger Testing
↓
Admin UI / App UI
↓
Integration Testing
↓
Regression Testing
↓
Move to Next Module
```

---

## 4.2 Codex Rules

Codex must:

* Read relevant docs before implementation.
* Modify only requested modules.
* Avoid unrelated refactors.
* Preserve existing working functionality.
* Add Swagger documentation for every API.
