Version: 2.0
Product Name: AAHAR
Document Type: Technical Requirements Document
Status: Updated for Hospital → Store/F&B → Kitchen → Restaurant Architecture

---

# 1. Technical Vision

AAHAR shall be developed as an enterprise-grade hospital Food & Beverage Operations Platform.

The system must support the complete lifecycle:

```text
Hospital Setup
↓
Store/F&B Setup
↓
Kitchen Setup
↓
Restaurant Setup
↓
Item Master / Menu / Pricing / Discount
↓
MRP Procurement / GRN / Batch / Expiry
↓
Kitchen Production
↓
Distribution to Restaurant
↓
Restaurant Acknowledgement
↓
POS / QR / Room / Employee Ordering
↓
Invoice / KOT / Payment
↓
Restaurant Closing
↓
Supervisor Approval
↓
ERP/SUN Posting
```

The platform must be secure, auditable, scalable, and suitable for hospital operations.

---

# 2. Core Technical Principles

## 2.1 Hospital-First Architecture

Hospital is the top-level entity.

All major business transactions must be linked to:

```text
hospital_id
business_date
created_by
created_at
```

Affected modules:

* Store/F&B
* Kitchen
* Restaurant
* Counter
* Inventory
* GRN
* Transfers
* Orders
* Payments
* Closing
* ERP
* Reports

---

## 2.2 Domain-Based Modular Architecture

AAHAR shall be developed domain by domain.

Recommended domains:

```text
Identity & Access
Hospital Administration
Master Data
Store/F&B Inventory
Kitchen Production
Distribution
Restaurant Stock
Order Management
POS Billing
Payment & Reconciliation
Kitchen KOT
Delivery
Restaurant Closing
ERP/SUN Integration
Reports & Audit
```

Each domain must have clear:

* APIs
* DTOs
* Services
* Repositories
* Validation
* RBAC
* Audit logging

---

## 2.3 API-First Development

Every feature must expose documented REST APIs before UI integration.

All APIs must be visible in Swagger.

Base path:

```text
/api/v1
```

Swagger path:

```text
/api/docs
```

---

## 2.4 Single Inventory Engine

AAHAR must not create separate stock systems for Store, Kitchen, Restaurant, and Counter.

Use common inventory engine:

```text
stock_ledgers
stock_balances
```

Supported location types:

```text
STORE
KITCHEN
RESTAURANT
COUNTER
```

Rule:

```text
Never update stock balance without creating stock ledger.
```

---

## 2.5 Common Order Engine

AAHAR must not build separate order systems for POS, QR, Room Order, and Employee Order.

Use one common order engine with:

```text
order_source
customer_type
rate_type
delivery_type
payment_mode
```

Supported order sources:

```text
ROOM_CALL
ROOM_QR
COUNTER_POS
TABLE_QR
EMPLOYEE_MOBILE
EMPLOYEE_QR
EMPLOYEE_COUNTER
```

---

---

## 3.6 Containerization

Use:

```text
Docker

```

Production may use:

```text
Azure App Service
Azure Container Apps
AKS
```

depending on final deployment decision.

---

# 4. Monorepo Structure

AAHAR shall use a monorepo.

# 20. Codex Development Rules

Codex must:

1. Read relevant docs before generating code.
2. Modify only requested modules.
3. Avoid large unrelated refactors.
4. Preserve existing working functionality.
5. Add Swagger for every API.
6. Add validation for every DTO.
7. Add RBAC for protected APIs.
8. Add audit logging for critical actions.
9. Run lint/build after changes.
10. Return files created, files modified, and test commands.

Codex must not:

* Build Menu before Organization refactor is complete.
* Build POS before Inventory and Menu logic are ready.
* Build separate order engines for each order source.
* Update stock without ledger.
* Bypass payment safety logic.
* Disable security for convenience.
* Remove existing working APIs without approval.
